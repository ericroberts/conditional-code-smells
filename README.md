### Conditionals are Code Smells: Programming Without "If"

If/then/else is one of the first things a new programmer learns. But, like any tool, it can be overused. Too much conditional logic makes your methods hard to understand and reason about. What if we started thinking about our code differently? What if we started telling our code what to do instead of asking it what it can do? This talk will go through a real refactoring from a method with more than 30 if/then/else statements to a solution with no conditional logic whatsoever.
